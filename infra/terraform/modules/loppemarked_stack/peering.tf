# ---------- Shared-DB VPC Peering (requester side) ----------
#
# Provides a private network path from the API Lambda (in this VPC's private
# subnets) to the shared RDS instance owned by `infra-shared-db`. We create a
# peering connection per environment so staging and prod fail independently and
# each carries a distinct Name tag.
#
# Gated on `var.shared_db_vpc_id`: when null (the default) no peering resources
# are created. The accepter-side route, RDS SG ingress, and
# `accepter.allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution` are owned by the shared-db repo,
# whose `data.aws_vpc_peering_connection` lookup cannot resolve until this
# requester apply exists. `auto_accept = true` works because both VPCs live in
# the same AWS account and region. DB traffic does not move onto this peering
# until DB_SECRET_ID is wired in Phase D; the connection is preparatory.
