# Incident Triage Runbook

## Overview

This runbook covers initial triage steps when a CloudWatch alarm fires or an operational issue is reported for the UN17 Village Rooftop Gardens platform.

## Alarm Reference

| Alarm | Metric | Threshold | Likely cause |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `*-lambda-errors` | Lambda Errors | >0 for 2×5 min | Application bug, dependency failure |
| `*-lambda-throttles` | Lambda Throttles | >0 | Concurrency limit reached |
| `*-rds-cpu` | RDS CPUUtilization | >80% for 3×5 min | Slow queries, missing indexes, traffic spike |
| `*-rds-freeable-memory` | RDS FreeableMemory | <128 MB | Instance under-provisioned, connection leak |
| `*-rds-connections` | RDS DatabaseConnections | >80 | Connection pool exhaustion, Lambda scaling |
| `*-ses-bounces` | SES Bounce | >5/hr | Invalid recipient addresses |
| `*-ses-complaints` | SES Complaint | >1/hr | Spam reports, consent issue |

## Triage Steps

### 1. Acknowledge the alert

- Check the SNS notification email for alarm name and environment.
- Open the [CloudWatch dashboard](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-north-1#dashboards) for the affected environment.

### 2. Assess severity

- **P1 (Critical):** API fully down, DB unreachable. Escalate immediately.
- **P2 (High):** Elevated error rate, throttles blocking users.
- **P3 (Medium):** Resource nearing limits (CPU, memory, connections).
- **P4 (Low):** SES bounces/complaints, non-blocking.

### 3. Investigate Lambda errors

1. Open CloudWatch Logs for the API Lambda:
   ```
   Log group: /<naming-prefix>/api
   ```
2. Filter for error-level log entries (JSON logs):
   ```
   { $.level = "error" }
   ```
3. Check for recent deployments that may have introduced the issue:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 5
   ```
4. If related to a recent deploy, consider rolling back:
   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-code \
     --function-name <function-name> \
     --s3-bucket <deploy-bucket> \
     --s3-key <previous-version-key>
   ```

### 4. Investigate Lambda throttles

1. Check current reserved concurrency setting in Terraform variables.
2. Review concurrent executions metric on the dashboard.
3. If `lambda_reserved_concurrency` is set to `-1` (unrestricted), throttles indicate an **account-level** concurrent execution limit has been reached, not a function-level issue. Check the AWS Lambda service quota.
4. If traffic is legitimate, increase `lambda_reserved_concurrency` via Terraform or request an account-level limit increase.

### 5. Investigate RDS issues

1. Open RDS Performance Insights in the AWS Console.
2. Check for long-running or blocked queries.
3. Review connection count trends on the dashboard.
4. For CPU spikes, identify top SQL statements in Performance Insights.
5. For connection exhaustion, check if Lambda is scaling faster than the connection pool can handle.

### 6. Investigate SES issues

1. Check the SES console for bounce/complaint details.
2. Review the `emails` database table for recent `failed` status entries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM emails WHERE status = 'failed' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```
3. For high bounce rates, verify recipient email addresses in registrations.
4. For complaints, review email content and sending consent.

### 7. Resolve and document

1. Apply the fix (code change, config update, or infrastructure adjustment).
2. Verify the alarm returns to OK state.
3. Document the incident in a GitHub issue with:
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause
   - Resolution
   - Follow-up actions (if any)
